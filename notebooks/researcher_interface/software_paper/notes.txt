Notebooks accompanying the paper:
"""
    ReSurfEMG: a Python package for comprehensive analysis of respiratory
    surface EMG
"""

All analyses were run with ReSurfEMG 1.0.2. The Jupyter Notebooks for these
analyses can be found in the folder `ReSurfEMG_1_0_2`

The Notebooks in the folder `ReSurfEMG_1_1_0` are adapted to run on ReSurfEMG
1.1.0 to improve forward compatability and re-use. As compared to ReSurfEMG
1.0.2, with which the analysis for the paper was conducted, this
includes refactoring of methods and no signal analytical adapations:
- Signal indexing:
    TimeSeries.y_raw
    -->
    TimeSeries['raw]
- Convert signal_type to signal_io arguments:
    signal_type='raw'
    -->
    signal_io=('raw', 'filt')
- Split gating and wavelet_denoising in ECG peak detection (.get_ecg_peaks)
    and ECG removal (.gating, .wavelet_denoising)
